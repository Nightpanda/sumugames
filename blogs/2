    			"Our team had a bit of a disorganized start. The group was just formed and everybody was eager to get to work. Everyone started to work on what was their primary expertise, unfortunately project management wasn’t anyones main deal. So we tried to run along with a lot of communication between the team and just generally using Trello to try and track what needed to be done, who was doing it and what had been done. This worked partially. It became clear that there needed to be a person who’s responsibility it was to make sure the project management was done clearly.",
    			"So we decided that I would start doing this. This will be an interesting learning experience for me. So far we’ve seen that once a person was appointed, things started flowing more smoothly. Everyone could concentrate on what they were doing and occassionally I would hold group meetings so that the lead persons of each part would be up to date.",
    			"As for management tools, after Trello not picking up, we decided to run with a physical scrum-board. Good old post-it notes that represented a to-do list for our scrum-sprint for the first prototype.",
    			"So far our project management looks better, although it does create a bit of extra work that takes away from my other tasks, like programming. But this works well for my own profile as the team wizard. ^_^"
